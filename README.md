## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have practiced CSS flexblox on this one. 

So, I really had a hard time getting the "learning" badge up and runnin. In the first place, I though it was a button, lol. Then by reading other peers code I realized that it was a sort of badge, I do not know if this type of element has a name. Besides being a flex item, is there a for this button-alike object?? Well, then I appled CSS flex and it turns out that I could not make it wrap to the content and started a long conversation with chat gpt, because the paid course I watched, and from where I got a basic grasp of CSS flexbox, said I could leave the CSS "Display" property as "flex", then "flex-direction: column;" and, then, if I applied the "Display: inline-flex;" then the item "Learning" (with yellow background) will just shrink-wrap based on the content width. But this never happened. Then, as you can see, I then used the property "align-self: flex-start;" to finally got it to wrap to the content. So, in that sense, I would appreciate if someone could give their insights on this. (Hopefully this explanation makes any sense.)

Thanks in advance.
